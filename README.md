## Description of the Modules

### Library Module
[ADM1266_Lib.py](ADM1266_Lib.py) contains all the ADM1266 related functions which are called by the user interfacing scripts. It is not recommended to modify this library.

### PMBus Module
[PMBus_I2C.py](PMBus_I2C.py) contains call APIs which uses the Total Phase Aardvark dongle to communicate with the ADM1266.  
If a different i2c dongle is used, the user need to include the APIs for that specific dongle.

### User Interfacing Scripts
Scripts such as [ADM1266 Load Firmware and Configuration.py](ADM1266_Load_Firmware_and_Configuration.py), [ADM1266 Blackbox Read.py](ADM1266_Blackbox_Read.py), [ADM1266 Telemetry Read.py](ADM1266_Telemetry_Read.py), etc are user interfacing scripts which call required functions in the [ADM1266_Lib.py](ADM1266_Lib.py) to perform a specific task.
Minor modifications are required by the user to update the script with their system specific information. The required modifications are described in [Modifications Applicable to All User Interfacing Scripts](#modifications-applicable-to-all-user-interfacing-scripts) and [Modifications Applicable to Firmware and Configuration Loading Script](#Modifications-Applicable-to-Firmware-and-Configuration-Loading-Script).

#### Address Specification
All ADM1266 scripts which communicate over the PMBus accept the addresses of the
device(s) as command line arguments.  One or more addresses may be provided,
depending on the number of devices in system. The leading 0x may be omitted.

For example:
`python 'ADM1266 Telemetry Read.py' 40 0x62`  for devices at 0x40 and 0x62.

By default if no addresses are specified, the system will use 0x40 and 0x42.

## User Specific Modifications

### Modifications Applicable to PMBus_I2C
This section covers the modifications required in [PMBus_I2C.py](PMBus_I2C.py) to interface with a different I2C dongle or master. Common modifications in the section below is not applicable for this module.  

**`PMBus_Write_Read(device_address, write_data, read_length)`**
This function is provided with the ADM1266 device address, register address, and the number of bytes to be read. It returns array of data byte which is read back from the ADM1266. Within the function, `aardvark_py.aa_i2c_write_read` API needs to be updated with a similar API of the new I2C dongle or master.

**`PMBus_Write (device_address, write_data)`**
This function is provided with the ADM1266 device address and the data which needs to be written to the ADM1266. Within the function, `aardvark_py.aa_i2c_write` API needs to be updated with a similar API of the new I2c dongle or master.

**`Open_Aardvark(Number)`**
This function is Total Phase Aardvark specific. It can be removed if a different I2C master is used.

**`Open_Aardvark()`**
This function is Total Phase Aardvark specific. It can be removed if a different I2C master is used.

### Modifications Applicable to All User Interfacing Scripts
This section covers the modifications that are applicable for all the user interfacing scripts, listed below:  
[ADM1266 Load Firmware and Configuration.py](ADM1266_Load_Firmware_and_Configuration.py)  
[ADM1266 Telemetry Read.py](ADM1266_Telemetry_Read.py)  
[ADM1266 Blackbox Read.py](ADM1266_Blackbox_Read.py)  
[ADM1266 Margin - Closed Loop.py](ADM1266_Margin_-_Closed_Loop.py)  
[ADM1266 Margin - Open Loop.py](ADM1266_Margin_-_Open_Loop.py)  

#### Aardvark Specification
By default the script will utilize the first un-used Aardvard detected in the 
system.  If a specific Aardvark needs to be utilized, the device's unique ID
needs to be added to the Open_Aardvark function call.

For Example:
The unique ID, 1845957160, in the following line of the script requires to be 
updated with the unique ID of the dongle which is used to communicate with the ADM1266. 
`PMBus_I2C.Open_Aardvark(1845957160)`
The unique ID of the dongle is printed on the dongle, shown in Figure 1.
<p>
    <img src="images/Unique_ID.png"/>
    <br>
    <em>Figure 1. Unique ID on the Dongle</em>
</p>  

#### Default Addresses
To change the default addresses of the scripts, modify the following line in the
\_\_main\_\_ of each script.

`ADM1266_Lib.ADM1266_Address = [0x40, 0x42]`

Note: [The addresses may be passed in to the scripts via command line arguments](#address-specification)

### Modifications Applicable to Firmware and Configuration Loading Script
This section covers the specific modifications required only for [ADM1266 Load Firmware and Configuration.py](ADM1266_Load_Firmware_and_PMBus_Configuration.py).

#### Step 1:
The firmware file which will be used to program all the ADM1266 is defined in the following line of the script. The same firmware file will be used to program all the ADM1266 in a system. The following example points to the latest firmware hex file, which is included with the script.
`ADM1266_Lib.firmware_file_name = "adm1266_v1.14.2_b0.hex"`
If the firmware file is in the same directory as [ADM1266 Load Firmware and Configuration.py](ADM1266_Load_Firmware_and_PMBus_Configuration.py), it is only required to enter the name of the firmware HEX file, otherwise the full path is required.

#### Step 2:
The configuration file which will be used to program all the ADM1266 in a system is defined in the following line of the script. Each ADM1266 in a multi-device system will have its own unique configuration file. Each configuration file is separated by a comma. 
The following example is for programming two configuration files to two ADM1266, [2 Board Demo-device@40.hex](Firmware_Configuration_Files/2_Board_Demo-device@40.hex) is programmed in ADM1266 at address 0x40 and [2 Board Demo-device@42.hex](Firmware_Configuration_Files/2_Board_Demo-device@42.hex) is programmed in ADM1266 at address 0x42.
The configuration file names should be listed in the same order as PMBus addresses defined in Step 3 of Modifications Applicable to All Scripts.
`ADM1266_Lib.config_file_name = ["2 Board Demo-device@40.hex", "2 Board Demo-device@42.hex"]`
If the configuration files are in the same directory as [ADM1266 Load Firmware and Configuration.py](ADM1266_Load_Firmware_and_PMBus_Configuration.py), it is only required to enter the name of the configuration files, otherwise the full path is required.
