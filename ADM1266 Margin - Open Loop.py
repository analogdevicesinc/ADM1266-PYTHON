# This script uses the Aardvark from Total Phase drivers to communicate with ADM1266.
# If you would like to use other devices, please comment out the Aardvark sections below.
# Open PMBus_I2C.py and replace aardvark_py APIs with the dongle APIs that you are using.
# No other modification is required
